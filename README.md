Objectives:

-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.

-Visualize the findings using various plots to gain insights into the data.

Key Activities:

-Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.

-Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any inconsistencies in the data.

-Data Exploration:

-Summary Statistics: Compute summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

-Distribution Analysis: Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of variables.

-Correlation Analysis: Compute and visualize correlations between variables using heatmaps.

-Outlier Detection: Identify and visualize outliers using scatter plots and box plots.

-Data Visualization: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create various plots for visualizing the data.

Technologies Used:

-Python: The programming language used for the analysis.

-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

-numpy: For numerical operations.

-matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

-seaborn: For statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.

Key Insights:

-Distribution of Variables: Histograms and box plots revealed the distribution of the data, highlighting skewness and the presence of outliers.

-Correlation between Variables: Heatmaps showed significant correlations between certain pairs of variables, indicating potential relationships.

-Outliers: Scatter plots and box plots identified outliers, which could be important for further analysis or modeling
